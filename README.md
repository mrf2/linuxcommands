# Linux Commands – My Personal Toolkit

This repository is a quiet place where I collect and refine the Linux commands I actually use, explore, and want to deeply understand.  
It’s not a cheat sheet — it’s a living reference for my own journey through the command line.

I update these notes slowly over time as I internalize patterns, debug real systems, or revisit forgotten details.

## Contents

- [find-and-grep.md](find-and-grep.md): Notes on combining `find` and `grep` for recursive file search, filtering, and inspection. Includes real examples, syntax breakdowns, and small learnings I want to remember.
- [grep.md](grep.md): Notes on using `grep` for searching text and files.

(More entries coming as I explore each command in depth.)

## Philosophy

I’m not trying to document everything — only the things I want to **remember**, **understand**, and **reuse**.  
Each file here is built slowly and deliberately, with the goal of becoming a reliable personal toolkit — not a fast reference for others.

> Built for reflection. Shared quietly.
